# Hello_World 
My name is Tony Oleshko, and I am a Junior at the University of Iowa. I grew up in Waukee, Iowa where I attended Waukee High School. I am pursuing a double major in accounting and businiess analytics & information systems. In my free time I enjoy everything sports, watching and playing. I am a member of the club baseball team on campus, and I enjoy participating in intramurals such as football, volleyball, and softball. I am a huge Chicago sports fan. Along with participating in sports I enjoy staying active through working out at the rec on campus. Since moving into an apartment with some friends last year I have developed a hobby for cooking. I am excited to network here on GitHub
